PokemonBox()
//this contains x number of pokemon

make your own background or take one from online and stretch it to fit the window
display pokemon images and cursors and numbers appropriately
the box needs a nickname (Box x by default where x is an integer)
the box needs a collection(arraylist, list, collection) of Pokemon

==================
YOU GET THIS ONE TOO

ItemBox()
same thing but the collction will be of Items, keyItems, pokeballs, or TMs

==================

both classes need methods to return and set the box name

both classes need a way to obtain all of the collection elements and one at a specific index
